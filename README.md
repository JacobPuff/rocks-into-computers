# Rocks Into Computers
A presentation on some computer internals and how we combine them to do useful things.

### Running
To view the slides, if you're on linux you can run `runServe` in the `compiled/` folder to get the local server running. Then go to `localhost:8080/presentation.html`, and find the "Video Settings". In the video settings click the dropdown next to "RENDER" and click the "PRESENT" option. Then hit the present button and you're good to go.

You can also `npm install` in the root directory, and run `npm run serve`.
